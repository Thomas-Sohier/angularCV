## Why ?

It's a personnal project that i made, because i wanted a beautiful CV and i wasn't too good with Word and i didn't want to pay my CV on some online web site.

It's in angular because why not ? I'm a bit experienced with it so i made it quite easily.

My code is ugly but it get the jobs done ðŸ˜€
